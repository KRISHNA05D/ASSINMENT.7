    "The close() function is used to close an open file in Python. When you are done with a file, it is a good practice to close it using the close() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance of Closing a File\n",
    "Releases System Resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "When a file is opened, the operating system allocates resources (like memory and file descriptors) to handle the file. Closing the file releases these resources back to the system, preventing resource leaks.\n",
    "Ensures Data Integrity:\n",
    "\n",
    "When a file is open for writing, data may be buffered (temporarily stored in memory) before being written to the file. The close() function flushes the buffer, ensuring that all data is written to the file and not left in the buffer. This helps maintain data integrity.\n",
    "Prevents Data Loss:\n",
    "\n",
    "Not closing a file can lead to data loss, especially when writing. If the file remains open, some data might not be saved correctly because it remains in the buffer instead of being written to disk.\n",
    "Avoids File Corruption:\n",
    "\n",
    "If a file remains open and the program unexpectedly terminates, it can cause file corruption. Closing the file ensures that it is properly saved and closed.\n",
    "Allows Other Programs to Access the File:\n",
    "\n",
    "An open file is often locked, which may prevent other programs or operations from accessing it. Closing the file removes the lock, allowing other processes to use it."

    "Why Use the with Statement with open()?\n",
    "Using the with statement with open() ensures that files are properly opened and closed without the need for explicitly calling the close() method. When the block of code inside the with statement is executed, Python automatically takes care of closing the file, even if an error occurs during the file operations.\n",

    "Automatic Resource Management:\n",
    "\n",
    "The with statement automatically closes the file when the block of code is exited, whether it exits normally or due to an error. This ensures that resources such as file handles are released promptly.\n",
    "Cleaner and More Readable Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "The with statement makes the code easier to read and reduces the need for explicit cleanup code (file.close()). This improves the overall readability and maintainability of the code.\n",
    "Exception Safety:\n",
    "\n",
    "If an exception occurs inside the with block, the file will still be properly closed, preventing resource leaks and data corruption. Without the with statement, you would need to manually handle exceptions and ensure the file is closed properly.\n",
    "Less Error-Prone:\n",
    "\n",
    "When using open() without with, forgetting to close the file is a common mistake that can lead to issues like running out of file handles or locked files. The with statement mitigates this risk."
